# CISC3003 Web Programming Project Assignment - Individual Part
## Chosen Project: A Simple Shopping Cart System by Mr. Web Designer

## Project Setup:
1. Make sure you have installed XAMPP, and have the Apache Server & MySQL Server included.

2. RUn the Apache Server and MySQL by clicking the start button in the XAMPP Control Panel.

3. Initialize Database. Open `localhost/phpmyadmin`, click "New" button on the left side to create a new database. Name this database as `shop_db`. This name is used for configuration in PHP.

4. Import the Database. Click the "Import" button on the top right side of the page. Select the `shop_db.sql` file in the project folder, and click "Go".

5. Since you have the Apache Server and MySQL Server running, you can now access the project by typing `localhost/add_product.php` in the browser.
